                <p>
                    BROCKHAMPTON's "37th" was one of my favorite tracks from The Family album released in 2022. This track exudes a melancholic nostalgia accessed through member Kevin Abstract's introspective look at the current state of his music and what's best for himself moving forward.<br>
                    Sonically, this track is consistent, containing a simple melody and looped vocal sample. The soft percussion and warping done on the vocal sample construct a low energy template that leaves a lot of room for the lyrics to drive a narrative. The beat takes a back seat to said lyrics, sounding almost like an outro that is held for the entire 2 minutes and 15 seconds of the song. However, this is rather fitting considering the context of closure, disbandment, and finality surrounding this album. The lyrics are delivered with a similar calm, lulled-ness, as they walk the listener through the thoughts of Kevin Abstract on this very context. This overall calmness reinforces the theme of nostalgia by paralleling the simplicity of the time he wishes to return to. Together, the beat and vocals, feed into the equally present tone of fatigue. The delivery of the lyrics does little to counteract the lull of the track. Even in the most energized portions of the lyrical delivery, Kevin Abstract's passion is diverted away from the track and channeled towards the withdrawal discussed in the lyrics. In this subdued way, the track's sonic approach to reflection creates a clear sense of Kevin Abstract's nostalgia for the past.<br>
                    However, why he wants to return to the past is only demonstrated through the lyrics. Overall, the lyrics discuss the downward spiral of Kevin Abstract and how easy creating music felt when the band was first established. This alone conveys why he may wish to return to this time, however, these statements do little to justify this nostalgic yearning which is instead baked in to the writing. For example, in brief mentions of relevant details to the band, like Ameer Vann and 37th street (where the band did a lot of their Saturation Trilogy work), Abstract does not elaborate the significance to the listener. He, instead, relies on the audience to know the context and significance. This uncareful approach to references is wonderfully employed to signify the choice of Kevin Abstract to return to what he enjoys doing. Instead of explaining everything to the listener and making a song that everyone can enjoy and understand, Kevin Abstract crafts an ode to his friends and himself where there is no need to care for the casual listener. In this way, the audience is semi-removed from this narrative which contains the dissolving of BROCKHAMPTON and the tough choices made by the individual members, allowing Kevin Abstract to return to the freedom of making music for himself.<br>
                    In the use of a simplistic track and largely un-elaborative lyrics, Kevin Abstract self reflects in way that allows him to get closure in sharing his opinions while simultaneously freeing himself and his future from the audience's expectant pressure. I find this theme of nostalgia highly compelling, especially with the unique spin of fatigue that can be felt so strongly on this track. While saddening, the dissolving of the band heightens the impact of self revealing tracks like "37th" but the spin put on the situation creates a happiness in the members being free to now do what they want, making it a very satisfying listen.
