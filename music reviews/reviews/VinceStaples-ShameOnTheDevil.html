                    Vince Staples' "Shame On The Devil" is a stand out for me on his most recent, 2024, Dark Times album. It takes similar sonic elements from previous work employing distorted guitar elements to achieve a chill beach-adjacent sound. The hip hop drums are also more laid back and dry as to not pull the track along too quickly. Ultimately, the two leave a lot of room for Vince to rap however quickly or slowly he sees fit. In this way, most of the raps feel like Vince is simply placing them on the track. However, the content is hardly lackadaisical as he dissects his growing fame and how it has largely alienated him from what he used to know. A layer of complexity is added in subsequent verses as he ponders whether he is selfish or simply taking on a role that brings him undeserving scrutiny. Effortless delivery while covering complex topics with calculated flows is very enticing and really hooks the listener into the track. Embelishment wise, instrumental components, chorus sample, and some vocals swell and seem to spin around the listener with high levels of reverb and distortion. Together it creates a sort of underwater or dissociated feel where Vince is isolated within his own music and left to speak his heart in the vocals. I really enjoy when artists can parallel the meaning of lyrics in sonic choices and Vince skillfully accomplishes that on this track making it one of my favorites off the album.<br>
