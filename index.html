				<h2>Academic Interests</h2>

					I am currently a Research Assistant at Purdue working with Dr. McPherson.
					I received my undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing and a Music Industry minor from UCLA in the spring of 2024.
					My specific research interests lie in studying computational models of human audition which I currently get to explore through pitch perception.  
					Much of the visual system has been broken down and functionally replicated in computational systems while the auditory system has not received the same amount of attention. 
					I hope to help develop these computational models of auditory processing. 
					I believe that a computational understanding of how humans perceive sound will shed light on the fundamental sonic features required to give rise to complex, rich, experiences like music perception.

					In my free time I like to snowboard and listen to music. I try to make music from time to time but ultimately think I should stick to the science of it.
					When I'm back home in Colorado I like to do a little trail running if the altitude doesn't kill me and hangout with my two cats and dog.
