					I am a research assistant at Purdue conducting research in Dr. McPherson's lab.
					I graduated with my bachelor of science degree in Cognitive Science with a specialization in computing and a Music Industry minor from UCLA in spring of 2024.
					My specific research interests lie in studying computational models of human audition, and I currently get to explore this through pitch perception research.  
					Much of the visual system has been broken down and functionally replicated in computational systems while the auditory system has not received the same amount of attention. 
					I hope help rectify this disparity by developing these computational models of auditory processing. 
					I believe that a computational understanding of how humans perceive sound will shed light on the fundamental sonic features required to give rise to complex, rich, experiences like music perception.

					In my free time I like to snowboard and listen to music. I try to make music from time to time but ultimately think I should stick to the science of it.
					When I'm back home in Colorado I like to do a little trail running if the altitude doesn't kill me and hangout with my two cats and dog.

			<p>Welcome to a little slice of the internet where I get way too excited about computational auditory neuroscience.</p>
